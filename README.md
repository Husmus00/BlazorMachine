# blazormachine

A web-based "port" of my [C# Mano Machine](https://github.com/Husmus00/Mano-Machine-CSharp/) project using [Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor) to run the existing C# code on web browsers.

The 'main' branch contains the project code, and the 'gh-pages' branch contains the generated website displayed using Github Pages.

Can be viewed at <https://husmus.dev/blazormachine/>

Still a work in progress.
